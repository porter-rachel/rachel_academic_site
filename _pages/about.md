Welcome! I am the Notre Dame du Lac Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and a Computational Social Science Faculty Fellow with the Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society. Additionally, I co-direct the <a href='https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/research/representation-and-politics-in-legislatures-lab/'>Representation and Politics in Legislatures Lab</a> within the Rooney Center for American Democracy.

My research is driven by substantive questions in public opinion and political psychology: How and why do citizens change their attitudes on political issues? How do these attitude changes drive mass polarization? How is polarization causally related to other features of government and society? As a computational social scientist, I answer these questions by using and developing rigorous methods in natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference, with a particular focus on high-quality measurement.

I received my PhD in 2023 from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I was awarded the Dean's Distinguished Dissertation Award for the best dissertation in the social sciences. I also hold an MA from UNC-Chapel Hill and a BA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and American Political Science Association, among others, and published in venues such as the American Political Science Review and American Journal of Political Science.
